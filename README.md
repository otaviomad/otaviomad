## hi

welcome to my incredible github profile

do not be fooled by my lack of activity, my organization does not allow me to show it on my profile

### me

i'm 25, i live in the netherlands, i like videogames, music and film. ask me about my favourite weird japanese art pop albums. you'll notice a distinct lack of styling on this readme. that is because i am ~~lazy~~ a minimalist.

### my skills

i am (very) good with typescript. i am very good with react. i really enjoy working with svelte. i know a bunch of backend stuff and have worked with php.

### my projects

- a game

a game is being worked on. no repository of mine is public. i am sorry.
